At one point we were getting a number way higher than what it was supposed to return, but then we learned that we need to be resetting the value of count each time we do our recursive calls so that we aren't compounding the counts. Kate and I spent a lot of time at the boards working out the algorithm, and once we had our initial try working (albeit slowly) we started to look at how to incorporate a dynamic programming approach. we settled on making another array that will store the number of ways each value from 1 through the target can be made, which we then can use to shorten the amount of time it takes to do our recursive calls later. i haven't written this out yet but I think I have a good idea of how to approach it. |

I thought i had an idea of what to do with that info but its not working. I think my if statement is in the wrong place. |

I talked with sierra a bit about how to implement a dynamic programming solution, but after brainstorming for a bit we couldn't figure out anything feasible and decided to wait until class to ask for a hint. |
| January 29 | 10:55-11:35am | Did some more work and brainstorming with sierra. We worked at the boards for a bit and tried writing out the recursive calls but we ultimately figured out that our approach isn't really compatible with dynamic programming. i think the main issue is that the way in which we prevent duplicates is never allowing a coin to be added to the sequence after a coin that is larger than it, so as we progress through the recursion, we are only looking at coins of increasing value. But, because we are recursing from low to high, we are  solving our 'smaller problems' but never allowing ourselves to use those smaller solutions in creating the larger solutions because we are trying to avoid duplicates. I think we really just need to find another way to stop duplicates. Or I was thinking a little bit about going from high to low but idk if that would actually work. |
