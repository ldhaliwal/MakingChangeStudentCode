| January 27 | 12:45-1:45pm | did an initial try, got a working algorithm but it times out on everything except the small run. At one point we were getting a number way higher than what it was supposed to return, but then we learned that we need to be resetting the value of count each time we do our recursive calls so that we aren't compounding the counts. Kate and I spent a lot of time at the boards working out the algorithm, and once we had our initial try working (albeit slowly) we started to look at how to incorporate a dynamic programming approach. we settled on making another array that will store the number of ways each value from 1 through the target can be made, which we then can use to shorten the amount of time it takes to do our recursive calls later. i haven't written this out yet but I think I have a good idea of how to approach it. |

I thought i had an idea of what to do with that info but its not working. I think my if statement is in the wrong place. |
